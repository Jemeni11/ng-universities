# ng-universities

This is a public API of comprehensive, community-driven database of Nigerian universities, their faculties, and departments.

## How to Contribute

**Data Format**:
   - Create a new JSON file in the `data/universities/` folder
   - Name the file using the university's lowercase name with hyphens (e.g., `kwara-state-university.json`)
   - Follow the standard JSON structure provided in the third section below


**Contribution Steps**:
   1. Fork the repository. You can learn how to do that by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9ftoxZ2X9g)
   2. Clone the repository with this command `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ng-universities`
   3. Move into the directory with this command `cd ng-universities`
   5. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b add-university-data`)
   5. Add your university JSON file or edit a pre-existing university file with more info
   6. Run the data validation script with this command: `pnpm run validate-unis`.
   You can also decide to validate a specific file instead of running the validation script on the entire university data by doing the following:
   ```shell
   pnpm run validate-unis --file kwara-state-university
   ```

   Or on a set of files like this:

   ```shell
   pnpm run validate-unis --file university-of-lagos,ekiti-state-university
   ```
   7. Commit your changes with this command: `git commit -m "a message indicating what you've done"`

   Before you commit, please make sure it follows the conventional commit message pattern. Learn more [here]("https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary"). See the following info below:

   - **Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.
   - **Scope**: (optional) A noun describing the part of the codebase the commit affects.
   - **Description**: Short and imperative summary of the change.

   ```shell
   git commit -m "fix(ui): resolve navbar bug on mobile"
   ```

### **Troubleshooting Guide**:

1. This project uses `pnpm` for package management. If you don't have it installed, you can do so by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

   Alternatively, you can follow the [comprehensive installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

2. If you've mistakenly used `npm`, `yarn`, or any other package manager, please follow these steps:
   - Delete the `node_modules` folder and any lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, etc.).
   - Reinstall the packages using `pnpm` by running:

     ```shell
     pnpm install
     ```

3. To ensure you're working with the latest version of the project and avoid conflicts, make sure your forked repository is up to date with the main repo. Here's how:
   - Navigate to your forked repo at `https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/ng-universities`.
   - Click on the `Sync Fork` button and then click `Update Branch`:
